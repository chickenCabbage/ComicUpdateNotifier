	<p>To subscribe to the email updates, send an email titled "subscribe:" and then the comics you want to subscribe to seperated by a comma. I.E: "subscribe: prague race, tiger tiger, leppus blog" will subscribe the sender to all three. To unsubscribe, do the exact same thing but with the word "unsubscribe" instead of "subscribe". Say you're not really interested in Tiger Tiger anymore, send "unsubscribe: tiger tiger".</p>
	<p>As you can see, this site isn't really built for users - it's built for the raw data. When it's in plain-text, such as the things here are, it's much easier to use that data in queries from AJAX or the like.</p>
